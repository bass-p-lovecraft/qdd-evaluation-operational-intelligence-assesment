# QDD Evaluation Operational Assessment of Intelligence

### Prototype Version 0.5

**Purpose:** Evaluation of disclosure quality scoring analysis system

## Overview

The most recent metric used in assessment of UFO disclosure community members analyzes the **direction and quality of their intelligence contributions**. This framework evaluates whether working members contribute value to the disclosure mission.

## QDD Evaluation Framework

**Qualitative Directional Disclosure (QDD)** assesses whether an informant provides actionable, forward-pointing guidance that contributes positively to progressing toward full or improved disclosure (e.g., revealing hidden truths, achieving transparency on sensitive topics).

### Purpose & Application

This evaluation rubric distinguishes **high-value disclosures** that provide momentum from those that are merely confirmatory or vague. It enables systematic assessment of sources and contributors in ongoing disclosure events.

## Expanded QDD Scoring Cards Metrics

The following table presents a **crowdsourced, evolving set of proposed metrics** for the **Qualitative Directional Disclosure (QDD) Scoring System**. These metrics are designed as individuating, distinguishing scoring criteria with a primary focus on **evaluationally correct attribution**—that is, assigning positive or negative weight to characteristics that reliably signal genuine forward momentum in disclosure versus narrative occupation, redirection, or theater.

### Key Conventions and Principles

- **Convention in evaluation is followed, not parity in quantity.** Positive and negative indicators are weighted according to their diagnostic power in distinguishing high-value disclosure from low-value or counterproductive activity. There is no requirement for numerical balance between “positive” and “negative” metrics.

- While the QDD prototype draws conceptual and structural inspiration from the **NCI Engineered Reality Scoring System v8.3** (particularly its 20-criterion matrix form), it does **not** seek identical numerical parity or symmetrical coverage. The current list exceeds 20 items because it represents a **larger proposed set for prototyping and refinement**, sourced from community input and adapted specifically to the disclosure domain.

- The ultimate objective is a **lean, directly applicable instrument** containing only those metrics that demonstrate unique diagnostic value within the specific context of disclosure intelligence. Quantity is provisional; **quality and directional clarity** are the sole selection criteria. Ideological or structural parity with the parent NCI system is not a goal.

### Evaluation Discipline and Structural Constraints

Every proposed **QDD metric** must adhere strictly to the following criteria:

- **No metric overlaps another’s function.**
  Each metric must detect a distinct evaluative signal and cannot be substituted or proxied by any other metric in the set.

- **Each metric answers one question only.**
  Metrics are atomic and focused; they are not composite bundles requiring multiple interpretive steps.

- **Metrics remain grounded in observable characteristics** of the disclosure artifact or actor, avoiding interpretive layering or subjective aggregation.
